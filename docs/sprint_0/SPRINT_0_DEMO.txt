1. Review the Brief and the initial Dataset

	First week as a group -> Database Design and defining relationships
	Data -> relationships and data type 'stuff' (null etc)
	ERD diagram

2. Review the initial Query List

	JAVA over SQL????

	We took User Story 1(data import) and broke it down as follows:
		-> Create base JEE ('Full stack REST project') project
			* Most importantly creating the entities with relationships
			* Difficulty here was using Composite Foreign Keys
				-> Using Embedded Keys in JAVA
		-> Listener on a directory?
			* Used JAVA WatchService API
		-> File upload through and convert web interface
			* Used HTML post method, initially BUT!
			* We needed to change this to Node.js due to ...APACHE POI...
		-> File validation, convert if necessary
			* Check file extension and convert if necessary
		-> Scan .csv file and validate data
			* Checked for valid datatype formats. Including converting to correct date format.
		-> Check relationships -> Persists data to database
			* Check for valid foreign keys 

3. Provide the user stories to the product owner to populate the Product Backlog 
       
    -> Basic Dataset import and Database setup (User story 1 - DONE)

4. Simple Query (data retrieval and display) execution via basic GUI
 
	-> Retrieve all of main data via button clicks


5. The prototype should also contain the basic scalable architecture for the application 

	-> Split logic across JEE layers:
		* REST layer for HTTP requests (POST, GET ...)
		* Service layer (EJB) for business logic (using FACADE design)
		* DAO Layer for CRUD transactions with the Database
